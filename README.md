#### What’s Tabnine

Tabnine is an AI code assistant that makes you a better developer. Tabnine will increase your development velocity with real-time code completions, chat, and code generation in all the most popular coding languages and IDEs.

Whether you call it **IntelliSense, intelliCode, autocomplete, AI-assisted code completion, AI-powered code completion, AI copilot, AI code snippets, code suggestion, code prediction, code hinting, content assist, unit test generation** or **documentation generation**, using Tabnine can massively impact your coding velocity, significantly cutting down your coding time.

#### Under the hood / Tabnine technology

Tabnine is powered by multiple language-specialized machine learning models that were pre-trained from the ground up on code. All of Tabnine’s AI models are trained on open-source code with permissive licenses. Tabnine's AI completions can be run on a developer's laptop, on a server behind your firewall, or in the cloud.

#### Complete code privacy

Your code always remains private.
<br />
<br />
Tabnine NEVER stores or shares any of your code. Any action that shares your code with the Tabnine servers for the purpose of private code models (part of enterprise) requires explicit opt-in. Tabnine does not retain any user code beyond the immediate time frame required for training models. Private code models created by Tabnine Enterprise are only accessible by your team members.

#### Trained on open-source code with permissive licenses

Tabnine only uses open-source code with permissive licenses for our Public Code trained AI model (MIT, MIT-0, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, Unlicense, CC0-1.0, CC-BY-3.0, CC-BY-4.0, RSA-MD, 0BSD, WTFPL, ISC). Whether you’re using Tabnine’s Pro plan or our Basic plan, your code, and AI data are NEVER used to train any models other than private code models.<br />

#### Tabnine Chat (Beta)

Tabnine Chat is a private and secure AI assistant that’s been trained on permissible open-source code only, and is always available to answer any of your questions right in your IDE.

With Tabnine Chat you can basically ask any question regarding code, for example, you can generate code that performs a specific task, generate tests for specific code, generate documentation for existing code, explain the purpose of legacy code, and way more.
