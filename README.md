## Boost developer productivity with AI-powered chat and code completions

Tabnine offers best-in-class AI code completion and an AI-powered chat that increases productivity and accelerates the entire software development lifecycle.

## Here’s what you can do with Tabnine:

**Test**: Ask Tabnine to create tests for a specific function or code in your project, and get back the actual test cases, implementation, and assertion. Tabnine can also use existing tests in your project and suggest tests that align with your project’s testing framework.

#### The AI code assistant that you control

Unlike generic code assistants, **Tabnine is:**

- **Private:** You choose where and how to deploy Tabnine, either as a secure SaaS offering or self-hosted on-premises or in a VPC). We never store your data or share it with any third party. Additionally, we don’t use your data to train our models. This ensures complete privacy and maximizes control over your intellectual property.

- **Personalized:** Tabnine delivers an optimized experience for each developer and engineering team. You can increase Tabnine's contextual awareness by making it aware of your environment — from a developer’s local IDE to the entire codebase — and receive highly personalized results for code completions, explanations, and documentation. Tabnine enterprise customers can further enrich the capability and quality of the output by creating a bespoke model that’s trained on their codebase.

- **Protected:** Tabnine is built with enterprise-grade security and compliance at its core. It’s trained exclusively on open source code with permissive licenses, ensuring that you’re never exposed to legal liability.
