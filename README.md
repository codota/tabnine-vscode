# Next-Level Productivity for Professional Developers & Teams

Tabnine is the AI code completion assistant **trusted by millions of developers** to amplify coding accuracy and boost productivity. Whether you are a new dev or a seasoned pro, working solo or part of a team, your Tabnine AI assistant will suggest team-tailored code completions in all the most popular coding languages and all your favorite IDEs.
<br />

## NEW Team Learning Algorithm for Pro Users

Team Learning takes your AI assistant’s abilities beyond the billion+ lines of training it begins with and adds a personalized understanding of how your team likes to code.

With Team Learning enabled, your AI assistant continually improves as it observes and adjusts to every new coding decision you and your teammates make. That unique understanding gives your development team a productivity edge, elevating and amplifying the accuracy of the code you create.
<br />

## Easy & Secure GitHub Integration

Take your Team Learning even farther with GitHub integration. Tabnine makes it easy and secure for Pro users to grant their AI assistant read-access to the Github repositories they specify. Simply assign the repositories you want your AI assistant to learn from, and provide the permissions.

Every line of team-created code your AI assistant learns from amplifies the accuracy of its code completion predictions, boosting productivity for you and your entire development team.
<br />

## AI Accuracy Just Got An Upgrade

Tabnine’s AI algorithm combines the precision of personalization with the power of machine learning based on a billion+ lines of trusted open-source code.

<br />

### Tabnine Support

Having some trouble with installation? Something not working the way you hoped? **Tabnine Support** is always happy to help. Feel free to contact us anytime at support@tabnine.com
<br />

### Tabnine Hub

A quick click on **_Tabnine_** on your IDE status bar takes you directly to your **_Tabnine Hub_** where you can easily update and manage all your account options and customize your suggestion preferences.
<br />

### Usage

After installation, navigate to the **_Tabnine Settings_** page (Open **_Settings_** from the Command Palette) and verify that Tabnine is successfully loaded (as shown in these [screenshots](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)).

Tabnine is a textual autocomplete extension. When you type a specific string in your editor, you will be shown the Tabnine completion dialog box with suggestions for completing the code you’ve begun typing.
<br />

### Deep Completion

Deep Tabnine is trained on millions of files from GitHub. During training, Tabnine’s goal is to predict the next token given the tokens that came before. To achieve this goal, Tabnine learns complex behavior, such as type inference in dynamically typed languages.

Deep Tabnine can use subtle clues that are difficult for traditional tools to access. For example, the return type of `app.get_user()` is assumed to be an object with setter methods, while the return type of `app.get_users()` is assumed to be a list.

Deep Tabnine is based on GPT-2, which uses the **_Transformers Network Architecture_**. This architecture was first developed to solve problems in natural language processing. Although modeling code and modeling natural language might appear to be unrelated tasks, modeling code requires understanding English in some unexpected ways.

- Tabnine Indexes your entire project and determines which files to ignore by reading your `.gitignore`
- Tabnine cuts your number of keystrokes in half and eliminates unnecessary typos
- Tabnine works right out of the box ensuring frictionless installation and configuration
- Tabnine offers code completion suggestions in less than 10 milliseconds
