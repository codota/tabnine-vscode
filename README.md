### **Privacy**

Concerned about privacy and security? So do we!
​

Your code’s privacy is our highest priority. Tabnine keeps your code completely private
​

Tabnine offers code completion suggestions based on a model trained on millions of open-source code lines, which are then derived from the code you are currently working on. Tabnine only sends minimal contextual information from your currently edited file that allows us to make predictions based on your current local scope
​

We do not use your code to train our models and the information sent to our servers is only used to compute your prediction and is not being saved on our end

- The default behavior of Tabnine is using the Enter key to accept completions.
  If you want to use the Enter key to start a new line instead of accepting a completion, just go to ‘Settings → Editor: Accept Suggestion On Enter’ and turn it off.
  ​

##### **Manual Installation inside VSCode**

- Press `Cmd+P` in your Visual Studio Code, type in ext install `Tabnine.tabnine-vscode` and press `Enter`
  ​
- Click the Reload button in the extensions tab
  ​

### **Technical information**

​
Tabnine Indexes your entire project by reading your `.gitignore` or others and determines which files to index.

- Add long variable names using minimal keystrokes
- Zero configuration. Tabnine works out of the box
- Highly responsive: Produces a list of suggestions in less than 10 milliseconds on average
  ​

##### **Usage**

​
After Tabnine’s installation, navigate to the Tabnine Settings page (‘Tabnine: Open Settings’ from the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)) and verify that Tabnine local model is successfully loaded (as shown in the following screenshots)
​

Tabnine is a textual autocomplete extension. When you type a specific string in your editor, you will view Tabnine completion dialog, with Tabnine suggestions according to the text you type
​

##### **Deep Completion**

​
Deep Tabnine is trained on millions of files from GitHub. During training, Tabnine’s goal is to predict the next token given the tokens that came before. To achieve this goal, Tabnine learns complex behavior, such as type inference in dynamically typed languages

​
Deep Tabnine can use subtle clues that are difficult for traditional tools to access. For example,
the return type of `app.get_user()` is assumed to be an object with setter methods, while the return type of `app.get_users()` is assumed to be a list
​

Deep Tabnine is based on GPT-2, which uses the Transformers Network Architecture. This architecture was first developed to solve problems in natural language processing. Although modeling code and modeling natural language might appear to be unrelated tasks, modeling code requires understanding English in some unexpected ways
