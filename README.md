## Bigger Team - Better AI

**Tools Your Team Can Count On**
Coding collaboration just got easier. Both **Tabnine Basic** and **Tabnine Pro** now include our growing suite of tools for teams. Name your team, invite team members, and manage your account all from your **My Tabnine** profile.

**Learn & Grow as You Go**
The more team members you invite and add, the faster Tabnine’s **Team Trained AI**, and **Private Codebase Trained AI** will learn your team’s projects, preferences, and patterns, suggesting even more accurate code completions.
<br />

## Privacy & Compliance

**Your Code Is Never Shared**
At Tabnine we know privacy is paramount. All three of Tabnine's AI code completion models can be run locally, on your machine, and NEVER share your code or use it as part of Tabnine’s open-source trained AI.

**Your Data is Never Shared**
Both the Team Trained AI and Private Codebase AI store all your AI training data locally on your machines, helping ensure compliance while providing you and your team with complete control and custody of your data and code.

### Tabnine Support

Having some trouble with installation? Something not working the way you hoped? **Tabnine Support** is always happy to help. Feel free to contact us anytime at support@tabnine.com
<br />

### Tabnine Hub

A quick click on **_Tabnine_** on your IDE status bar takes you directly to your **_Tabnine Hub_** where you can easily update and manage all your account options and customize your suggestion preferences.
<br />

### Usage

After installation, navigate to the **_Tabnine Settings_** page (Open **_Settings_** from the Command Palette) and verify that Tabnine is successfully loaded (as shown in these [screenshots](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)).

Tabnine is a textual autocomplete extension. When you type a specific string in your editor, you will be shown the Tabnine completion dialog box with suggestions for completing the code you’ve begun typing.
<br />

### Deep Completion

Deep Tabnine is trained on millions of files from GitHub. During training, Tabnine’s goal is to predict the next token given the tokens that came before. To achieve this goal, Tabnine learns complex behavior, such as type inference in dynamically typed languages.

Deep Tabnine can use subtle clues that are difficult for traditional tools to access. For example, the return type of `app.get_user()` is assumed to be an object with setter methods, while the return type of `app.get_users()` is assumed to be a list.

Deep Tabnine is based on GPT-2, which uses the **_Transformers Network Architecture_**. This architecture was first developed to solve problems in natural language processing. Although modeling code and modeling natural language might appear to be unrelated tasks, modeling code requires understanding English in some unexpected ways.

- Tabnine Indexes your entire project and determines which files to ignore by reading your `.gitignore`
- Tabnine cuts your number of keystrokes in half and eliminates unnecessary typos
- Tabnine works right out of the box ensuring frictionless installation and configuration
- Tabnine offers code completion suggestions in less than 10 milliseconds
