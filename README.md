<br />

### Usage

After installation, navigate to the **_Tabnine Settings_** page (Open **_Settings_** from the Command Palette) and verify that Tabnine is successfully loaded (as shown in these [screenshots](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)).

Tabnine is a textual autocomplete extension. When you type a specific string in your editor, you will be shown the Tabnine completion dialog box with suggestions for completing the code you’ve begun typing.
<br />

### Deep Completion

Deep Tabnine is trained on millions of files from GitHub. During training, Tabnine’s goal is to predict the next token given the tokens that came before. To achieve this goal, Tabnine learns complex behavior, such as type inference in dynamically typed languages.

Deep Tabnine can use subtle clues that are difficult for traditional tools to access. For example, the return type of `app.get_user()` is assumed to be an object with setter methods, while the return type of `app.get_users()` is assumed to be a list.

Deep Tabnine is based on GPT-2, which uses the **_Transformers Network Architecture_**. This architecture was first developed to solve problems in natural language processing. Although modeling code and modeling natural language might appear to be unrelated tasks, modeling code requires understanding English in some unexpected ways.

- Tabnine Indexes your entire project and determines which files to ignore by reading your `.gitignore`
- Tabnine cuts your number of keystrokes in half and eliminates unnecessary typos
- Tabnine works right out of the box ensuring frictionless installation and configuration
- Tabnine offers code completion suggestions in less than 10 milliseconds
  <br />

### Privacy and Compliance

Tabnine’s code completion AI uses both cloud and local models. For both models your team’s code and AI training data are only used to provide the service, and your code is never shared nor used as part of Tabnine’s open-source trained AI.
