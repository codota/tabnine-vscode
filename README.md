#### What’s Tabnine

Tabnine is an AI code assistant that makes you a better developer. Tabnine will increase your development velocity with real-time code completions in all the most popular coding languages and IDEs.

Whether you call it **IntelliSense, intelliCode, autocomplete, AI-assisted code completion, AI-powered code completion, AI copilot, AI code snippets, code suggestion, code prediction, code hinting,** or **content assist**, using Tabnine can massively impact your coding velocity, significantly cutting down your coding time.

#### Under the hood / Tabnine technology
Tabnine is powered by multiple language-specialized machine learning models that were pre-trained from the ground up on code. All of Tabnine’s AI models are trained on open-source code with permissive licenses. Tabnine's AI completions can be run on a developer's laptop, on a server behind your firewall, or in the cloud.

#### Complete code privacy
Your code always remains private. 
<br />
<br />
Tabnine NEVER stores or shares any of your code. Any action that shares your code with the Tabnine servers for the purpose of training team models requires explicit opt-in. Tabnine does not retain any user code beyond the immediate time frame required for training models. Any team model created by Tabnine is only accessible to your team members.

#### Trained on open-source code with permissive licenses
Tabnine only uses open-source code with permissive licenses for our Public Code trained AI model (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause). Whether you’re using Tabnine’s Pro plan or our Starter plan, your code and AI data are NEVER used to train any models other than your own team models.<br />
