		/**
		 * A file can contain many tokens, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of tokens. Therefore, to improve
		 * the memory consumption around describing semantic tokens, we have decided to avoid allocating an object
		 * for each token and we represent tokens from a file as an array of integers. Furthermore, the position
		 * of each token is expressed relative to the token before it because most tokens remain stable relative to
		 * each other when edits are made in a file.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * In short, each token takes 5 integers to represent, so a specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:
		 *  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
		 *  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
		 *  - at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
		 *  - at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
		 *  - at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How to encode tokens
		 *
		 * Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a uint32 array:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",  tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",     tokenModifiers: [] }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 1. First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types.
		 * For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
		 * ```
		 *    tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
		 *    tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 2. The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked
		 * up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
		 * so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because
		 * bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 3. The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token
		 * is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar`
		 * of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the
		 * `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
		 * ```
		 *    { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
		 *    { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
		 * ```
		 *
		 * 4. Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *NOTE*: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until VS Code decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.
		 */
		provideDocumentSemanticTokens(document: TextDocument, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>;

		/**
		 * Instead of always returning all the tokens in a file, it is possible for a `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider` to implement
		 * this method (`updateSemanticTokens`) and then return incremental updates to the previously provided semantic tokens.
		 *
		 * ---
		 * ### How tokens change when the document changes
		 *
		 * Let's look at how tokens might change.
		 *
		 * Continuing with the above example, suppose a new line was inserted at the top of the file.
		 * That would make all the tokens move down by one line (notice how the line has changed for each one):
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 3, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property", tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
		 *    { line: 3, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",     tokenModifiers: [] },
		 *    { line: 6, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",    tokenModifiers: [] }
		 * ```
		 * The integer encoding of the tokens does not change substantially because of the delta-encoding of positions:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
		 * ```
		 * It is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // old tokens
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // new tokens
		 *
		 *    edit: { start:  0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] } // replace integer at offset 0 with 3
		 * ```
		 *
		 * Furthermore, let's assume that a new token has appeared on line 4:
		 * ```
		 *    { line: 3, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property", tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
		 *    { line: 3, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
		 *    { line: 4, startChar:  3, length: 5, tokenType: "property", tokenModifiers: ["static"] },
		 *    { line: 6, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",    tokenModifiers: [] }
		 * ```
		 * The integer encoding of the tokens is:
		 * ```
		 *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token,  4th token
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  1,3,5,0,2,  2,2,7,2,0, ]
		 * ```
		 * Again, it is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:
		 * ```
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]               // old tokens
		 *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  1,3,5,0,2,  2,2,7,2,0, ]  // new tokens
		 *
		 *    edit: { start: 10, deleteCount: 1, data: [1,3,5,0,2,2] } // replace integer at offset 10 with [1,3,5,0,2,2]
		 * ```
		 *
		 * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot compute `SemanticTokensEdits`, it can "give up" and return all the tokens in the document again.
		 * *NOTE*: All edits in `SemanticTokensEdits` contain indices in the old integers array, so they all refer to the previous result state.
